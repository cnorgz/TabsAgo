description: Enforce React + Tailwind UI conventions; service boundaries; no chrome API in components
globs: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}

# React UI & Architecture Conventions

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Small Chrome extension with iterative feature growth
- Must keep UI edits simple and predictable

## Requirements
- Components live under `src/components/<Feature>/<Name>.tsx`
- UI uses Tailwind-like utility classes or shared classes in `src/views/index.css`. Avoid new global CSS files.
- No inline styles for structural/layout; small one-off color/text allowed during prototyping only.
- Never call Chrome APIs directly in React components. Use services in `src/services/*`.
- Use constants from `src/constants/*` for keys/IDs; avoid magic strings.
- Keep file headers/imports organized; default exports for components, named exports for types.
- Prefer small, focused components. Lift shared logic into hooks in `src/hooks/`.

## Examples
<example>
// GOOD: Component imports service and types only
import { TabService } from '../../services/TabService'
import { TabItem } from '../../types/Tab'
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// BAD: Direct Chrome API access in components
const tabs = await chrome.tabs.query({ currentWindow: true })
</example>
