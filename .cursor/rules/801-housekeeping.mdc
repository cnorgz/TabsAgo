# Housekeeping & Workflow Prompts

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Requirements
- Before coding: run type-check, lint, tests when relevant.
- After significant edits: update docs (PROJECT_TRACKING.md, CODE_AUDIT.md) and summarize.
- Commit regularly with concise messages.
- **Git Discipline:** NEVER merge to `master` without explicit user validation. Always work on a branch.
- Periodically verify Chrome policy link in PHASE2_SPEC.md.
- Ask for clarification on unclear specs (⭐) before implementing.
- Ensure rules consistency with docs; do not ignore checklists.

## Triggers
- On starting a task: check ROUTINE_CHECKLISTS.md Pre-Coding Checklist.
- Before commit: run Quality Assurance Checklist items.
